Test Plan and Test Cases
The test plan of the project involves the following to check for the better performance with optimistic results.
•	To check the code for any errors or warnings which effect the system.
•	To check the working of the functions written in the code, like by giving input 1/2/3 it should perform the assigned operation correctly.
•	To evaluate the time taken to build and run the code.
Test Cases:
The movie ticket booking system doesn’t use any user-based test cases. It generally takes the inputs from user and executes the particular task like:
1.	Selecting the movie
2.	Number of tickets
3.	Seat numbers selection
4.	Confirming the seat number and count
5.	Purchasing by entering details like name and phone number
6.	Getting the confirmed receipt of booked tickets
